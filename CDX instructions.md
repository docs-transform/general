The steps below detail how to prepare a hands-on lab event booked through CDX

>[!note] If this is your first time accessing the CDX site you will need to setup your profile upon login. If this is your first time booking a hands-on lab event, you will need to request access to the **Events portal**. Send an email to Jogruszc@microsoft.com with the subject line **CDX Booking Access** with the details of what events you will be running

- 1. Browse to the **Events**[https://cdx.transform.microsoft.com/events] portal and login using your Microsoft, Microsoft partner, or MVP credentials
	>[!note] If you do not have access to the Events portal, please read the note above about requesting access
- 2. Select the **Create Event** button and provide the required event details on the **Create Event** page:
	- Select the most applicable **Event Type** for the event you're running, then provide a unique **Event Title** for your event (Redmond Teams Bootcamp 10-10-20)
	- For **Owner** list and **Add** the Microsoft or Partner emails organizing the training, not the facilitators who will be presenting the event (these are added later)
	- Provide the **Location, time zone,** and **Date** details for the event. Please ensure you're specifying these details where the event will be occuring, not your local location
	- Under **Additional info (optional)**, provide the attendee customer accounts or TPID for committeed customer attendees. If you do not know your audience you can add these details close to the event
	- Leave the rest of the **Additional info (optional** select empty
- 3. Select **Create Event** at the bottom of the page
- 4. On the **Event** page you just created scroll down and select the **Add Session** button - this is where you'll add your hands-on lab experience and provide session details
	- For **Title** list the subject of the hands-on lab experience you'll be adding (Teams Admin)
	- Select the **Date** this hands-on lab will be run on. Note that your event may span multiple days but this step is defining what day this hands-on lab will be available for.
		>[!alert] Labs can only run for 1 calendar day and cannot span multiple days due to security and governance restrictions
	- For **Start time** and **End time** use the hours the event will be run, such as 9:00am to 6:00pm. Please do not select a start and end time outside of your event hours
		>[!note] the lab facilitators will have access to the hands-on lab environment 4 hours prior to the start time, a **Start time** of 9:00am will allow facilitators access at 5:00am
	- For **Attendees expected** provide the number of attendees forecasted to attend the event. Please ensure this requested number is accurate to your attendee count, do not request more seats than needed
		>[!note] We encourage hands-on labs events to remain within the 50 seat limit. If more than 50 lab seats are required, please request 50 seats and contact the HOL General Support Team at support@handsonlabs.microsoft.com to provide the exact seats required up to 100 with business justification for your event
	- For **Proctor** list and **Add** the emails of the facilitators who are leading and presenting the hands-on lab experience. If the facilitator is not found use the **+ Add new proctor** button and provide the details
	- Under **Experience selection** select the radio icon button next to the hands-on lab experience that you'll be running
	- Confirm that all details are correct, then select the **Add session** button at the bottom of the page
- 5. Once the **Event** and **Sessions** have been booked, the scheduler and facilitator will receive and email with a calendar invite for the booked event.
- 6. After the event is booked, 12-48 hours prior to the event date the scheduler and facilitator will receive an email from the Mirosoft Hands-on Lab alias that will contain a unique tiny URL. This unique tiny URL contains the collection of lab seats and will be shared with event attendees to access the hands-on lab.
	>[!note] A reminder that the event facilitator will not have access to the virtual machines used in the hands-on lab until 4 hours prior to the session start time
